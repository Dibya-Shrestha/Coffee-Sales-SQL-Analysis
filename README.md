# Coffee-Sales-SQL-Analysis

# Project Overview
In this project, I utilised SQL commands to analyse coffee sales data. At first, the csv file was imported to SQL Server Management Sudio and a series of SQl queries were carries out to answer business related questions. The results generated by these queries are documented seperately in a comprehensive report.
